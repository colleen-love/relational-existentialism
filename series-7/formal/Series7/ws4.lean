WS4 — **The imports catalogued: the program explained.** Series 7.

Owns: exhibiting the import MECHANISMS as forced structural drops, and reading the Import
Theorem (WS2) as their predictor. Series 6's process is the confirming negative: it kept
(1)(2)(3), refused to import, and collapsed.

Design doc: `series-7/spec/ws4-design.md`.

REVIEW RESPONSE (project-review-1.md S2/S3/R6, recorded in `charter-status.md`). Pass 1 was
right that a single plain toy (`twoLoop`) cannot witness the label/index import: `twoLoop`'s
distinction is *killed by the behavioral quotient* (both states map to Ω), a drop of ingredient
(2); the label/index import is *real in the final object* (survives the quotient), a drop of
ingredient (1). The two mechanisms are NOT the same and are no longer equated. This pass
mechanizes BOTH mechanisms on genuine (if minimal) witnesses:
* **drop (1) — the LABELLED functor.** A labelled coalgebra `labelLoop` on the NON-plain
  functor `P_κ(Q × X)` whose two atomless states are distinct AND remain distinct under the
  label-respecting bisimulation quotient (`ws4_label_survives_quotient`) — behaviorally
  identified yet plural, escaping the theorem by dropping plainness. This is the label (S4) and
  the index (S5) at their common structural minimum.
* **drop (2) — the plain non-reduction.** `twoLoop` (WS1): two atomless states on the PLAIN
  functor, bisimilar-yet-unequal — a drop of behavioral identity.

Honest scope: the full Series 4 `νLk` / Series 5 `Winf` / Series 3 weight-algebra CARRIERS are
prior art, NOT re-transcribed here; what is mechanized is the drop-(1) and drop-(2) MECHANISMS
on minimal labelled/plain witnesses. The full-carrier unification is reported Partial.

REVIEW RESPONSE (project-review-2/pass-2 S1/S2/R2, recorded in `charter-status.md`). The
alignment pass showed the deeper problem: "labelled" (a `Q` in the signature) is not the charter's
"import" (a coordinate NOT carried by the relating). Two things are added/disclosed below:
(i) the charter-strength SEMANTIC import test — `ws4_free_label_is_import`: the label is an import
iff the plain (label-forgetting) relating cannot recover it (plain-bisimilar states carry distinct
labels) — and `ws4_recoverable_not_import`: a recoverable label is NOT an import; (ii) the honest
FAITHFULNESS disclosure — `labelLoop` is a FREE-label witness (a genuine import); the Series 4 face
`x↾(x,y)` is an ENDOGENOUS RESTRICTION (recoverable, hence NOT an import — a leaf/faced-boundary),
and Series 4 reached plurality only by ESCALATING the restriction into a free label. So the minimal
witness and the paradigm S4 carrier are NOT the same kind; the reclassification is stated below and
routed to WS3 (the faced-boundary is the candidate fourth kind) and WS7 (the audit certifies the
free-label import, not that the S4 restriction is one).

Sorry-free; axiom-clean beyond Mathlib's standard three.

Pass 2 was right: "labelled" (a `Q` in the functor signature) is NOT the charter's "import" (a
coordinate NOT carried by the relating, §4.1). The genuine test is **recoverability**: a label is
an import iff it is not determined by the plain, label-forgetting relating — iff two states the
plain relating cannot tell apart nonetheless carry different labels. `ws4_label_survives_quotient`
alone (survival under the label-MATCHING bisimulation) is the weaker, near-syntactic fact; the

recoverable (a function of the relating, as the Series 4 restriction `x↾(x,y)` is), then

/-! ## The recoverable label COLLAPSES; the free label IMPORTS (pass-2 S2, mechanized)

Two theorems close the conditional. First (`ws4_recoverable_atomless_collapses`) the abstract
collapse: a recoverable label imports nothing, so if the plain relating it forgets to is
behaviorally identified and atomless, the whole labelled carrier is a subsingleton — a recoverable
label can NEVER be the atom that rescues atomless plurality. Second, the two sides are witnessed:
`labelLoop` (a FREE label, the state's own identity) is proved NOT recoverable
(`ws4_labelLoop_not_recoverable`) — a genuine import; `facedLoop` (a RESTRICTION label, a function of
the relating, the shadow of `x↾(x,y)` on collapse-equal states) is proved `Recoverable`, and its
plurality is a DROP of behavioral identity, not an import. This is the Series 4 reclassification
mechanized on minimal witnesses (the drop MECHANISMS, as elsewhere in WS4); the literal `νLk` carrier
stays prior art, but "the restriction is recoverable, hence collapses" is now a theorem, not prose. -/

/-- **The recoverable-label collapse (abstract, general).** A recoverable label imports nothing: it
turns every plain bisimulation into a label bisimulation, so behavioral identity on the labels forces
behavioral identity on the plain relating; with atomlessness, `ws2_import_theorem_static` collapses
the carrier. This is the theorem the Series 4 restriction falls under — it CANNOT rescue atomless
plurality. -/

/-- **The free label is NOT recoverable — a genuine import.** The plain relating cannot tell the two

/-! ## RECLASSIFICATION of Series 4 (project-review-2/pass-2 S2, recorded in `charter-status.md`)

Pass 2 correctly identified that the charter's paradigm import — the Series 4 face `x↾(x,y)` — is a
RESTRICTION of the relatum, hence a FUNCTION of the relata, hence `Recoverable`, hence NOT an import
by `ws4_recoverable_not_import`. It is a **leaf** (a descent boundary, drop of ingredient (3)) — or,
more precisely, a *faced boundary*: a leaf that also carries a distinguishing quality, a cell the
leaf/import dichotomy does not enumerate (a named open, see `ws3.lean`). Series 4 reached plurality
only by ESCALATING the restriction into a FREE label on `νLk` (`loopState q` with arbitrary `q`) —
replacing the non-import with an import and keeping the name. So the honest catalogue reading is:
Series 4's *faithful* restriction is a leaf that collapses; Series 4's *plurality* is a free-label
escalation, which IS a genuine import (`ws4_free_label_is_import`). The two objects are different.
This corrects `ws4_program_explained`'s "S4 dropped (1)": what dropped (1) is the escalated free
label, not the restriction. This reclassification is now MECHANIZED (above): the restriction's
collapse is `ws4_recoverable_atomless_collapses` (recoverable ⇒ import-free ⇒ cannot rescue atomless
plurality), witnessed by `facedLoop` (`ws4_facedLoop_recoverable`); the escalation's import is
`ws4_labelLoop_not_recoverable`. The literal `νLk` carrier stays prior art — what remains prose is
only the identification of the actual face with the recoverable class, a modeling claim, not the
collapse itself. -/

/-! ## drop (2): the plain non-reduction (twoLoop), distinct from drop (1) -/

/-- **The plain non-reduction analogue.** `twoLoop`'s two atomless states are distinct yet
bisimilar on the PLAIN functor (a drop of behavioral identity (2)) — the distinction IS killed
by the behavioral quotient (both map to Ω). This is a DIFFERENT mechanism from the label import
above and is not equated with it. -/

/-- **S5 — the level-index REUSES the label mechanism.** (Interim-review C1: renamed and strengthened —
the term reuses the FULL drop-(1) label witness, including survives-quotient, and does NOT touch
`Winf`.) The tower's level-index is a label: the SAME drop-(1) mechanism, the index behaving as the
labelled coordinate. The full Series 5 tower colimit `Winf` is prior art, NOT re-transcribed — the
index-is-a-label identification is stated (prose), the structural drop witnessed via the label
mechanism. -/

predicts the drop — plurality on a plain coalgebra forces dropping behavioral identity or
atomlessness (`ws2_plurality_requires_drop`); (d) Series 6 is the confirmation — it refused the
drop, kept (1)(2)(3), and collapsed (`ws1_productive_unique`). Honest scope (pass-2 S2): this
explains the program *for the free-label imports*; the ENDOGENOUS cases (the S4 restriction, and
possibly the S5 index if the index is endogenous to the level structure) are recoverable, hence
leaves/faced-boundaries not imports — Series 4's plurality is a free-label ESCALATION of its
restriction, reclassified above. The full `νLk`/`Winf`/weight carriers are prior art. -/

/-! ## SUBSET-OF-A-RESTRICTION: does the collapse eat a distinction with no atom in it?

A probe of the tightness of `ws2_import_theorem`'s `atomless` hypothesis. A restriction `x↾(x,y)` is
recoverable and collapses; a free tag `q` is an atom and imports. A **subset of a restriction** sits
between: its material is entirely endogenous (made of the relata), so there is no atom in the
material. The question is whether the SELECTION of which sub-part to expose is fixed by the relating
(Case A) or free per state (Case B).

The engine `ws1_atomless_bisim` decides it, and the deciding fact is that atomlessness makes ALL
states plainOf-bisimilar. So the selection has nowhere to hide: either it agrees across that
bisimulation (Case A — collapses) or it does not (Case B — then it is a coordinate the relating does
not carry, i.e. an import, no matter that its values are endogenous subsets). The atom, when Case B
survives, is not in the material but in the free CHOOSING. There is no third option. -/

/-- **Case A engine — a relating-determined selection cannot distinguish (atomless + recoverable).**
On an atomless recoverable carrier every pair of states is label-bisimilar: `ws1_atomless_bisim`
already relates them plainly, and recoverability lifts that to the labels. A subset chosen by the
relating exposes nothing new; with behavioral identity this is the collapse. -/
theorem ws4_atomless_recoverable_all_bisimL {Q X : Type u} (dest : X → LkObj κ Q X)
    (hrec : Recoverable dest) (hatom : ∀ x, SHNE (plainOf dest) x) (x y : X) :

  obtain ⟨R, hR, hxy⟩ := ws1_atomless_bisim (plainOf dest) x y (hatom x) (hatom y)
  exact ⟨R, hrec R hR, hxy⟩

/-- **Case B decisive — on an atomless carrier, any surviving label distinction IS an import.**
If two states are not label-bisimilar yet the carrier is atomless, `ws1_atomless_bisim` makes them
plainOf-bisimilar, so recoverability would force a label-bisimulation between them — contradiction.
Hence the carrier is not recoverable: the distinction is a coordinate the relating does not carry
(§4.1), an import — regardless of what the label is MADE of. Atomlessness is exactly what forbids a
non-importing per-state distinction; the hypothesis is tight. -/

/-- **The verdict on subset-of-a-restriction (Case B): it SURVIVES, but as an import — no
counterexample.** The two states are atomless (no leaf) and plainOf-bisimilar, and their labels are
honest subsets of the state space (`subsetLabel`, no external tag); yet no label-bisimulation relates
them, so the plurality survives. By `ws4_atomless_label_distinction_imports` the carrier is therefore
NOT recoverable — the free selection is a coordinate the relating does not carry, an import. The atom
is not in the endogenous MATERIAL but in the free CHOOSING. So atomless plurality still bought an
import; `ws2_import_theorem`'s hypothesis is tight (and this is not in its scope — it is labelled),
and the recoverable-collapse `ws4_recoverable_atomless_collapses` still holds (this carrier is not
recoverable). -/
