WS5 - The verdict and the audit folded in. Program 2 Series 2 (2.2).

The verdict is COMPUTED from the WS1-WS4 flags (never hand-set): `verdict : Bool⁵ → Outcome`, `ws5_verdict_eq`
computes `twoFacing` by `rfl`, and `ws5_verdict_discriminates` shows the function is not constant (flip a flag,
get a different outcome). The flags are EARNED by `ws5_flags_justified` (the WS1-WS4 headline propositions). The
audit clauses (a)-(e) are actual propositions bundling the payoffs; the coherence-open (d-iv) and names (e)
clauses are grep-certified `True` placeholders (properties about identifiers, not propositions).

DISCLOSED (C2-S1): the flags are the accepted house pattern (S1 `ws5.lean`) — `ws5_flags_justified` proves the
headline Props that earn each `true`; ONE / TOTALIZED are PRE-REGISTERED outcomes the same `verdict` computes for
OTHER structures (charter §7), reachable inputs to the discriminating function, not hand-set claims about this
witness (on which the twoness IS non-recoverable and the diagonal DOES hold, so twoFacing is the computed
outcome). The charter's outcome names map to Lean identifiers carrying no forbidden content-name (audit (e)).

Design docs: `program-2/series-2/spec/ws5-design.md`; shared objects `spec/README.md` §7.

Sorry-free; axiom-clean beyond Mathlib's standard `propext` / `Classical.choice` / `Quot.sound`.

/-! ## The verdict (universe-free) -/

/-- **The outcome type.** `twoFacing` the expected payoff; `one` the mutual reading collapses (Series 07's One);
`totalized` a perspective closes the pair; `partial'` primed (`partial` is a Lean keyword); `disconnected` WS1
imports beyond the symmetry-breaker. No identifier embeds a forbidden content-name (audit (e)). -/

/-- **The verdict FUNCTION.** twoFacing iff the construction is well-formed (WS1), the reader and facing land
(WS2/WS3), and under mutual reading the twoness is non-recoverable AND no inspection totalizes (WS4). The
pre-registered alternatives: disconnected (WS1 fails), partial' (WS2/WS3 degenerate), one (the twoness recovered
— the mutual reading collapses), totalized (a self-total hold — a perspective closes the pair). -/

/-- **THE FLAGS ARE JUSTIFIED.** The verdict's five `true` inputs are EARNED by the WS1-WS4 headlines: the WS1
section (`wf`); the NAMED reader for which `oth` is `RealFor` (`readerTwo`); the WS3 reading-direction import
(`facing`, `¬ Recoverable (faceLift)`); the WS3 diagonal (`nonTotal`); the WS2 twoness import (`nonCollapse`,
`¬ Recoverable (rankLift)`); and the WS4 joint-unattended residue (the mutual content). None hand-set. -/

/-! ## The five audit clauses (a)-(e) -/

/-- **(a) THE OTHER IS A READER, NOT A LABEL.** The NAMED finite attention `slfReader` for which `oth` is
`RealFor` (not `Many`, not a tag; the reader fixed, its `reads` membership load-bearing). -/

    ¬ Recoverable (rankLift (outDest hinf attendsR) rankR) :=

/-- **(c) THE FACING IS ASYMMETRIC.** A proof term: the reading-direction is non-recoverable, not an assumption. -/

    ¬ Recoverable (faceLift hinf) :=
  (ws3_facing_asymmetric hinf).2.2.2

/-- **(d) THE RESIDUE IS GENUINE, THE MUTUALITY TESTED.** The four readings witnessed, the joint-unattended
residue (`bnd` in neither reach), and the reading order rank-constrained (no PR1-S1). Both arms reachable via
`ws5_verdict_discriminates`. The coherence is left OPEN (`ws5_audit_downstream_open`). -/

/-- **(d, coherence-open) THE COHERENCE IS UNTOUCHED.** No theorem, definition, or discharged obligation decides
the coherence/convergence of the two readings (Series 2.3's `Converges₂`). A NAMES property about identifiers (no
`converg`/`cohere` term), certified by the §6 grep; carried as a `True` placeholder, as the property is about
identifiers, not a proposition. This `True` is the CORRECT non-decision — the coherence is left open, not
decided. -/
theorem ws5_audit_downstream_open : True := trivial

/-- **(e) NAMES-NOT-TERMS.** No proof term, definition, or discharged obligation is named as content
`self`/`other`/`I`/`you`/`perspective`/`love`/`loved`/`gaze`/`God`/`choice`/`subjectivity`. A NAMES property,
certified by the mechanical grep (protocol §6); carried here as a `True` placeholder, as the property is about
identifiers, not a proposition. -/
