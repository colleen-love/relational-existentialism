WS5 - The verdict and the audit folded in. Program 2 Series 5 (2.5).

The verdict is COMPUTED from the WS1-WS4 flags (never hand-set): `verdict : Bool⁵ → Outcome`, `= acyclic` by
`rfl` on the certified flags, DISCRIMINATING (reaches all four outcomes), the flags EARNED by the WS2-WS4
headlines (`ws5_flags_justified`; WS1's fold-as-diagonal enters through audit (d), not as a flag). ACYCLIC is
reached ONLY when `relatingCycles` AND `loopedReachable` are true, so the knot rests on the COEXISTENCE (cyclic
relating + acyclic causation + the fold's uniqueness), not on well-foundedness alone (audit c). The five audit
clauses (a)-(e) bundle the payoffs; (e) is the grep-certified placeholder (the names property is meta, enforced
by protocol §6).

/-! ## The verdict (universe-free) -/

/-- **The outcome type.** `acyclic` the expected payoff (the relating loops but time does not); `looped` the
fold a genuine closed causal loop (time closes at the One); `shapeDrawn` the fork drawn but the tower's status
not forced; `partial'` primed (`partial` is a Lean keyword) an obligation degenerate. No identifier embeds a
forbidden content-name as a whole word (audit e). -/

  | looped
  | shapeDrawn
  | partial'
  deriving DecidableEq

/-- **The verdict FUNCTION.** `acyclic` iff the relating genuinely cycles (WS2), causation is acyclic and the
loop is localized to the fold (WS3/WS4), the LOOPED reading is reachable (WS4, no fiat), and the genuine tower
does NOT realize the self-membered fold point. The pre-registered alternatives: `partial'` (no cyclic relating,
or LOOPED excluded by construction), `shapeDrawn` (the tower not shown acyclic or the loop not localized),
`looped` (the genuine tower realizes the causal self-loop). -/
def verdict (relatingCycles causationAcyclic loopOnlyAtFold loopedReachable foldRealizedOnTower : Bool) :
    Outcome :=
  if !relatingCycles then Outcome.partial'
  else if !(causationAcyclic && loopOnlyAtFold) then Outcome.shapeDrawn
  else if !loopedReachable then Outcome.partial'
  else if foldRealizedOnTower then Outcome.looped
  else Outcome.acyclic

/-- **THE COMPUTED VERDICT.** On the certified flags (the relating cycles, causation is acyclic, the loop is
localized to the fold, LOOPED is reachable, the tower realizes no fold point), `acyclic`, by computation. -/
theorem ws5_verdict_eq : verdict true true true true false = Outcome.acyclic := rfl

/-- **Falsifiability.** The verdict DISCRIMINATES: it reaches all four outcomes. `looped` when the tower realizes
the self-loop; `shapeDrawn` when causation is not shown acyclic; `partial'` when the relating does not cycle, or
LOOPED is excluded by fiat. -/
theorem ws5_verdict_discriminates :

  ∧ verdict false true true true false = Outcome.partial'
  ∧ verdict true true true false false = Outcome.partial' := by decide

/-! ## The flags are earned -/

/-- **THE FLAGS ARE JUSTIFIED.** The verdict's five `Bool` inputs are EARNED by the WS2-WS4 headlines, none
hand-set: `relatingCycles` (WS2, the directed cycle reifies); `causationAcyclic` (WS3, no closed causal loop);
`loopOnlyAtFold` (WS4, a causal loop forces a self-constituting relatum, via `loop_forces_selfloop` on the WS3
rank-lift); `loopedReachable` (WS4, the self-loop IS reachable on `FCar`); and `foldRealizedOnTower = false` (the
tick carrier has no self-membered composite). WS1's fold-as-diagonal is not a flag; it grounds the fold's meaning
and enters through audit (d) (`ws5_audit_fold_is_diagonal`). -/

/-! ## The five audit clauses (a)-(e) -/

/-- **(a) NO POLES DECIDED ABSOLUTELY.** No smallest (`SHNE`, reachability-relative) and no largest (the
reification section produces a fresh relatum from any pattern, no absolute ceiling). -/
theorem ws5_audit_no_absolute_frame {κ : Cardinal.{0}} (hinf : ℵ₀ ≤ κ) :
    (∀ x : TCar, SHNE (outDest hinf attendsT) x)
  ∧ (∀ (X : Type) (attends : X → Finset X) (reify : Finset X → X),
        FinReify attends reify → ∀ x : X, attends (reify {x}) = {x}) :=
  ⟨fun x => ws1_no_pole_below hinf x,
   fun X attends reify h x => (ws1_no_pole_above attends reify h x).1⟩

/-- **(b) THE FORK NOT BY FIAT.** LOOPED is a reachable structure (`ws4_looped_reachable`), and the fold admits
no rank-lift (`ws4_fold_no_rank`); `causalDep` is structural (no rank in the definition), its acyclicity PROVED
(`ws3_causal_rank_lift`). -/
theorem ws5_audit_fork_genuine :
    Relation.TransGen (causalDep attendsF compF) om om
  ∧ (¬ ∃ rank : FCar → ℕ, ∀ t u, causalDep attendsF compF t u → rank t < rank u)
  ∧ (∀ t u : TCar, causalDep attendsT isTick t u → rankT t < rankT u) :=
  ⟨ws4_looped_reachable, ws4_fold_no_rank, ws3_causal_rank_lift⟩

/-- **(c) THE KNOT IS THE COEXISTENCE, NOT WELL-FOUNDEDNESS (load-bearing).** The proven INTERACTION, not a bare
conjunction of two independent facts: the SAME directed attention cycle `p0 ⇄ p1` carries NO causation
(`ws2_cycle_not_causal` - the loop is precisely the place causation is not), WHILE causation on the tick carrier
is acyclic (`ws3_causation_acyclic`). "The relating loops but time does not" is now a proof term: the loop is
non-causal, so time climbs OUT of it rather than around it. The verdict also demands the cyclic-relating flag, so
it rests on this coexistence, not on rank being well-founded alone. -/
theorem ws5_audit_knot_is_coexistence :
    ( (p1 ∈ attendsT p0 ∧ p0 ∈ attendsT p1)
      ∧ ¬ causalDep attendsT isTick p0 p1 ∧ ¬ causalDep attendsT isTick p1 p0 )
  ∧ ( ¬ ∃ x : TCar, Relation.TransGen (causalDep attendsT isTick) x x ) :=
  ⟨ws2_cycle_not_causal, ws3_causation_acyclic⟩

/-- **(d) THE FOLD IS THE DIAGONAL.** `ws1_fold` and the diagonal conjunct of `ws4_loop_only_at_fold` are the P1
diagonal (`ws2_residue_distinct` / `ws1_no_self_total_hold`); no import theorem is invoked. -/
theorem ws5_audit_fold_is_diagonal {X : Type u} (dest : X → PkObj κ X)
    (insp : Hold dest → HoldPred dest) :
    ( (∀ h, insp h ≠ residue insp) ∧ (¬ ∃ t, SelfTotal insp t) )
  ∧ ( ¬ ∃ t, SelfTotal insp t ) :=
  ⟨ws1_fold dest insp, ws1_no_self_total_hold dest insp⟩

/-- **(e) NAMES-NOT-TERMS.** A META-property about identifiers, not a proposition: no proof term, definition, or
discharged obligation is named as a forbidden content-word ("time," "loop," "causal," "fold," "pole," "self,"
"here," "there," "god," "choice," "subjectivity") as a whole word. Enforced by the protocol §6 mechanical grep
(hits are docstring prose only), not by this `True`; carried as the accepted house placeholder, the grep the
teeth.
Made non-vacuous at Program Review 2-1 (PR2-R2, the accepted S13 C1-S1 form): the statement below proves
the outcome codomain a genuine discrimination among neutrally-named values. -/

  ∧ Outcome.shapeDrawn ≠ Outcome.looped
  ∧ Outcome.looped ≠ Outcome.acyclic
  ∧ Outcome.partial' ≠ Outcome.acyclic := by
