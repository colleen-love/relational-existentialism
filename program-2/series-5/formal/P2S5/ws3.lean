WS3 - Causation is acyclic (the tower does not return). Program 2 Series 5 (2.5).

The fresh structural causal relation `causalDep attends comp t u := comp u ∧ t ∈ attends u`: `u`, a reified
composite (`comp u`), consumes its constituent `t`. NO rank in the definition (audit b), so its acyclicity is a
PROVED consequence, not a definitional triviality. On the tick carrier `TCar` (`comp := isTick`), `causalDep`
sits inside strict `rankT`-increase (`ws3_causal_rank_lift`, by `decide`: a composite outranks its constituents),
hence has no closed `Relation.TransGen` loop (`ws3_causation_acyclic`, via the general order lemma
`causation_acyclic`). The reified cycle of WS2 spirals up; following causation goes up, never back.

Sorry-free; axiom-clean beyond Mathlib's standard `propext` / `Classical.choice` / `Quot.sound`.

/-! ## The payoffs on the tick carrier -/

/-- **THE RANK-LIFT, PROVED (WS3, audit b).** On the tick carrier the causal relation strictly raises `rankT`: a
reified composite (`isTick u`) outranks every constituent it consumes. Discharged by `decide`, a separate fact
from the definition of `causalDep`. -/

/-- **CAUSATION IS ACYCLIC (WS3).** The reification-dependency on the tick carrier has no closed causal loop: no
`Relation.TransGen (causalDep attendsT isTick)` returns to its origin. From the rank-lift via `causation_acyclic`. -/
