# Scratch — mathlib-dependent work area

Mathlib-backed formalization, kept out of the default build so the dependency-free
core (`RelExist`) stays fast. Compiling this is what triggers the mathlib build.

* `Scratch.We`          — `≈ := νΘ` and the shared world `𝔼 := D/≈` (theorem T2),
                          via `OrderHom.gfp` (Knaster–Tarski). ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.Identity`    — A2 restated: identity is the lived `≈`; observation `≅` is a
                          **strictly lossy** projection. Proves soundness `≈ ⊆ ≅`, strictness
                          `≈ ⊊ ≅` (witness), and the non-injective forgetting `D/≈ ↠ D/≅` (the
                          first-person surplus). ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.Forgetting`  — the unification: identity-collapse, dephasing, and the partial trace are
                          one construction (`Coarsening`), each non-injective for the same reason —
                          a nonempty residue (surplus / copy-defect / entanglement). ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.Attention`   — attention as the co-directed eigenstructure of the relational
                          coupling (a consequence of structure, not a bolted-on budget);
                          the self as an eigenform `νΦ`. ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.Trace`       — D1/T1: trace as feedback (`selfTrace`) and the Conway
                          parameterized fixed-point operator (`Tr`). ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.KnowingFeeling` — the T3 contrast: knowing (Lawvere-obstructed) vs feeling
                          (`≈`, whole). ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.Chemistry`   — Layer 4, first domain functor: autocatalytic sets as
                          eigenforms (`νΦ`); the functor is definitional. ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.Biology`     — Layer 4, biology: Rosen's (M,R)-systems; closure to efficient
                          causation = the organism `ν(repair ∘ metabolize)`; the functor
                          is definitional. ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.Rel`         — `Rel` (sets & relations) as a genuine multi-object `TracedSMC`
                          instance: the full JSV axiom set, validated non-trivially.
                          ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.RelCoherence` — `Rel` promoted to a `CoherentTracedSMC`: the eight monoidal
                          coherence laws (pentagon, triangle, hexagon, naturalities,
                          symmetry), validated in a genuine multi-object model. ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.Recurrence`  — Layer 4, AI: recurrence/Geometry-of-Interaction. Feedback **is**
                          the trace (in `Rel`); sustained recurrence is the eigenform `νΦ`;
                          a self-consistent hidden state is sustained. ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.PartialTrace` — Layer 4, physics: the quantum **partial trace** on matrices and
                          its defining properties (linearity, vanishing-II, yanking,
                          full-trace compatibility). ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.MatrixModel` — Layer 4, physics: **the literal traced SMC** — finite types &
                          matrices, `⊗` = Kronecker, trace = partial trace, associators as
                          permutation matrices; the full JSV axiom set. `matTracedSMC`.
                          The named frontier, closed. ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.MatrixCoherence` — the matrix model promoted to a `CoherentTracedSMC`: all eight
                          coherence laws, via functoriality of permutation matrices. ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.Compact`     — Layer 4, categorical: compact closure, the firewall collapse
                          theorem, and categorical no-cloning (physics). ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.NoCloning`   — Layer 4, physics: the concrete (linear-algebra) no-cloning
                          theorem — cloning is nonlinear. ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.SparsityReal` — the ℝ-valued sparsity bound and density-→-0 statement
                          (the analytic upgrade of Lemmas 3.1/3.2). ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.Decoherence`  — Layer 4, physics: the quantum→classical passage in the matrix model
                          — `dephase`, the classical fragment, copyability ⟺ commutativity, and
                          the continuous `copyDefect`/`defectSq`. ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.Classical`    — the abstract (typeclass) companion: `DaggerCategory` and a
                          `Decoherence` structure, validated by the matrix instance. ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.Distribution` — self-in-other quantified in a Banach algebra: `distributed`/`total`,
                          the living regime `0<‖x‖<1`, the bound, and the quantitative
                          eigenform `sustained` (unique by contraction). ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.Feedback`     — the two sustained selves unified at the ν-modality
                          (`CoDirectedSelf`): lattice `νΦ` and Banach `sustained` as instances.
                          ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.Attending`    — directed attention as **selective decoherence**: `attend S` (partial
                          dephase), interpolating `id`⟶`dephase`, with the copy-defect proved
                          to drop monotonically — and a witnessed collapse; plus the irreducible
                          floor (the shared block attention cannot reach). ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.Conservation` — **decoherence *is* the partial trace**: entangle a system with an
                          environment (`entangle`); the global state stays coherent while its
                          partial trace (the relationship forgotten) is classical — coherence
                          conserved, only relocated. ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.Forgetting`   — identity-collapse, dephasing, and the partial trace as one `Coarsening`,
                          each non-injective for the same reason (a residue). ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.Knowing`      — the bridge: the gap is governed by relation; `≅` is the *disjoint*
                          (view-from-nowhere) observer; completeness ⟺ disjointness. ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.Registration` — `reg` derived from the `Φ_c` dynamics: registration *is* absorption. ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.Marginal`     — nondeterminism is a consequence of relation: a related whole's marginal
                          branches; local determinism ⟺ no relation. ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.RelationalMarginal` — …robustly, for any global law; deterministic conservation is the
                          priced corollary. ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.Convergence`  — the depth/threshold read off `Φ_c`'s orbit directly (not an abstract `σ`).
                          ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.Stabilization` — does the orbit converge? ω-convergence always (continuity), finite-depth
                          iff ACC. ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.Feeling`      — **feeling as a relational decoherence differential** (`≅ₒ`, not the
                          view-from-nowhere `≅`): conserved coherence carried across a relation. ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.RelationalAppearance` — relativizing the outside: soundness/surplus *survive and strengthen*
                          against `≅ₒ`, but "the surplus is exactly nondeterminism" does **not** — a
                          deterministic system has a relational surplus (feeling from the seam, not
                          choice). ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.QuantumSeam`  — bridge B route 2: the seam on the **actual** `dephase` (lossy, irreversible)
                          via **no-broadcasting** — the compact face of the firewall whose cartesian
                          face is Lawvere. (B-as-Lawvere/route 1 remains open.) ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.QuantumSeamTrace` — **bridge B, closed on the compact face**: the seam on the *genuine*
                          `ptrace` — it collapses `entangle a` and its decohered shadow to one marginal
                          (`ptrace_collapses_entanglement`), so a self with only its marginal cannot
                          recover the relation (`no_ptrace_recovery`), and the lost fiber is exactly the
                          non-broadcastable coherence; route 1 (Lawvere) is shown *firewall-obstructed*,
                          not merely unbuilt. ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.GraphModel`   — **Pω**, the Plotkin–Scott graph model: a concrete non-trivial reflexive
                          object — continuous self-maps are a retract of `Set ℕ` (`app (Graph f) = f`),
                          with the fixpoint (GoI's `Y`) and the `K` combinator. ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.SelfApplication` — the **internal `Y` combinator via self-application** in `Pω`: the diagonal
                          `fun x => app x x` is Scott-continuous (`selfApp_continuous`), so
                          `Y f := app (W f) (W f)` is an element and `app f (Y f) = Y f`
                          (`Ycomb_fixed`) — Lawvere's diagonal realized as the trace, concretely. Honest
                          caveat: `Pω` is the *cartesian* λ-model (the non-cartesian/linear reflexive
                          object is separate, firewall-constrained). ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.SparsitySharing` — **sparsity step 2 (cost-sharing):** footprints as `Finset`s of relatings,
                          cost = card. Sharing lowers spend (`subadditive_spend_le_sum`); the no-sharing
                          (disjoint) case recovers `≤ β/m` (`disjoint_count_bound`); but **full sharing
                          breaks** the count bound (`full_sharing_unbounded`) and a **positive private
                          footprint** is exactly what rescues it (`private_count_bound`). ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.ConwayTrace`  — the **Conway fixed-point operator on domains** (= the cartesian trace, by
                          Hasegawa): the parameterized lfp `pfp` with fixpoint/least/parameter-naturality,
                          the **rolling/dinaturality** rule `lfp (g∘h) = g (lfp (h∘g))` (the trace-slide
                          shadow; not in mathlib), and the Bekić **diagonal** rule. ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.DomainFixpoint` — the **Conway operator packaged**: the category of complete lattices &
                          monotone maps as a genuine multi-object `TracedSMC` (`domainFixpointTracedSMC`)
                          with `⊗ = ×` and the **fixpoint trace** `Tr(f)(a) = π₁(f(a, lfp(u ↦ π₂(f(a,u)))))`.
                          All seven JSV axioms discharged from the `ConwayTrace` identities — sliding via
                          a heterogeneous `rolling'`, vanishing-II via **product Bekić** (`lfp_prod`),
                          superposing via `tr_superpose`. The Hasegawa "only-if" direction in full; the
                          `ConwayTrace` packaging the spec flagged open. ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.ValuationBoundary` — the **valuation boundary:** a *densely-ordered* standing lattice admits
                          **no** ℕ-valuation (`no_strictMono_to_nat_of_dense`), so a non-unit numeric
                          per-return cost is *provably* unavailable without discretization — closing the
                          last sparsity residue as a proved boundary (ACC ⇒ μ; dense ⇒ no μ). ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.IntConstruction` — the **GoI / `Int` construction** on any traced SMC: the non-cartesian,
                          fully-dual (compact) arena where a linear reflexive object lives — objects
                          `(A⁺,A⁻)`, two-way homs, tensor/unit, and the **dual** (wire-swap) proved an
                          involution, monoidal, unit-fixing — **plus the dual's action on morphisms**
                          (`IntDualHom`, the contravariant transpose), proved identity-preserving and
                          **involutive** `(fᵈ)ᵈ = f` over a coherent traced SMC (0 axioms, by `γ∘γ = id`).
                          Composition-via-trace and the snake equations (and the dual's full
                          functoriality) are the flagged remainder. ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.RelCompact`   — **`Rel` compact closed + `Int(Rel)` composition**: the canonical model closed
                          concretely. Self-dual, diagonal cup/cap, **both zigzag / triangle identities**
                          proved `= id` (`rel_snake_{right,left}`), the `Compact.CompactClosed` name
                          bijection (`relCompactClosed`), **and the GoI composition-via-trace**
                          (`relIntComp`, `∃` over the shared loop) making `Int(Rel)` a **category** —
                          identity + **associativity** laws (`relIntComp_id_{left,right}`,
                          `relIntComp_assoc`), all `aesop`. The `Int` bridge's composition + snake axioms,
                          discharged in the canonical model; the abstract non-strict `Int(C)` stays the
                          named remainder. ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.ReflexiveCompact` — **a non-cartesian reflexive object**: in compact-closed `Rel` the
                          internal hom is `[D,D] = D* ⊗ D = D × D`, so a reflexive object is a `D` with
                          `D ≅ D × D`. **No finite object works** (`finite_not_reflexive`, `|D| = |D|²` ⇒
                          `|D| ≤ 1` — the compact-side Cantor obstruction), but **`ℕ` does**
                          (`natReflexive`, via the pairing bijection): `ℕ ≅ ℕ ⊗ ℕ = [ℕ,ℕ]`, the
                          linear/compact counterpart of `Pω`, in a category with **no copying**
                          (`rel_no_cloning`). The bridge's non-cartesian reflexive object. ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.SpectralDecay` — **the general spectral form of the conjecture**: write the dynamics
                          `T = P + N` (peripheral projection `P`, subdominant `N` with `‖N‖<1`,
                          orthogonal). `spectral_pow`: `Tⁿ = P + Nⁿ`; **`spectral_decay`: `Tⁿ → P`** — the
                          subdominant modes decay, only the peripheral eigenforms self-sustain. Conjecture
                          3.4's decay mechanism, in any normed ring; the `E`/idempotent case is the `N=0`
                          extreme (`idempotent_pow`). ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.PerronFrobenius` — **Perron–Frobenius existence** (the lift's last existence gap): a
                          column-stochastic map has **eigenvalue 1** (`exists_invariant_vector`, via the
                          all-ones vector fixed by `Mᵀ` and `det(M-1)=0`), and a *nonnegative* one has a
                          positive **invariant state** (`exists_invariant_state` — the full
                          Perron–Frobenius, by the `w = |v|` trick: `Mw ≥ |Mv| = w` with equal total ⇒
                          `Mw = w`, no Brouwer/Cesàro). The relational **weight** of Decision 1, existence
                          discharged in general finite dim. ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.DomainTraced` — the **simplest domains (complete lattices) as a `TracedSMC`** via the
                          join-monoid (the scalar/identity trace; *not* the Hasegawa fixpoint trace,
                          which stays open). ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.Causation`    — a causality `[reading]` made a theorem: **the missing cause is the other** —
                          conditioning on the other's hidden state restores determinism; local
                          indeterminism *is* the un-viewed relational cause. ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.SparsityPosits` — discharging the two sparsity posits: `d ≥ 2` given structural meaning
                          (**genuine return** = not-given ∧ not-one-shot, `genuine_return_iff`) and shown
                          load-bearing (positive floor ⟺ sparse vs dense); and the valuation `μ`
                          **constructed** as the orbit's return index (the genuine returns are strict
                          standing increases), discharging it for unit cost. ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.Orientation`  — **orientation from the seam**: knowing `E`
                          generates a *directed* (`knows_antisymm`), strictly *temporal*
                          (`arrow_strictAnti` — feeling falls along the arrow), and *irreversible*
                          (`no_recovery`) structure oriented knower→known, all three from one
                          idempotent-lossy operator; instantiated on the genuine `dephase`/`defectSq`
                          (`dephaseKnowing`), re-deriving `no_dephase_recovery` through the interface.
                          The `[proved]` core of the spec's one new theorem; "the arrow *is* time"
                          stays a `[reading]`. ✅ verified.
* `Scratch.Peripheral`   — the **spectral picture of knowing** (conjecture-lift Decisions 1–2): `E =
                          dephase` is an **idempotent**, so its eigenvalues are `⊆ {0,1}`
                          (`dephase_eigenvalue`) — the **veto-check**: *no rotating peripheral spectrum*
                          (`dephase_no_rotating_peripheral`), so for `E` peripheral = fixed. Eigenvalue-1
                          space = classical/known, eigenvalue-0 = feeling (`dephase_eigenspace_{one,zero}`),
                          every relation splits known ⊕ felt (`dephase_add_copyDefect`), and the standard
                          trace is the invariant weight (`dephase_trace_invariant`); the peripheral set
                          is **sparse** (`peripheral_sparse`, `1/card A` density). Generalized:
                          **any** conditional expectation (idempotent linear map) is `{0,1}`-spectral
                          (`idempotent_eigenvalue`) — the veto-check for every `E`. ✅ verified.
