# The arrow's sign — does the seam fix the direction of the flow?

The frontier beneath [`TimeFlow`](TimeFlow.lean) (spec §6). T-flow gives the *direction and rate* of
time's passage but inherits its **orientation** from `coh` decreasing — from decoherence. The deepest
claim is that the dissipative *sign* is not stipulated but **forced**: the self-inclusive partial trace
(the seam — the self cannot trace out the factor it is part of) leaves only the coh-decreasing arrow
realizable. This module mechanizes how much of that is reachable, and marks honestly what stays open.

Three rungs:

* **§A Acyclicity `[proved]`.** Over the bare `Flow` interface: while the orbit has not yet reached the
  fixed self, the potential is *strictly* antitone, so the orbit **never returns** to an earlier state
  (`Flow.orbit_ne`). The timeline is a genuine linear order with no closed loops before the self — an
  arrow, not a cycle. This is the order-theoretic content of irreversibility, from the monovariant
  alone.

* **§B The sign is the multiplier `[proved]`.** One step of the partial-dephasing flow multiplies the
  feeling by exactly `(1−p)²` (`defectSq_partialDephase`). So the flow **contracts** the feeling on
  every state iff `(1−p)² ≤ 1`, i.e. iff `0 ≤ p ≤ 2` (`contractive_iff`, `time_forward_regime`); it
  *expands* it — runs time backward, amplifying coherence — iff `p < 0 ∨ p > 2` (`expanding_regime`).
  The coh-decreasing sign is **exactly** the contractive regime: the direction is locked to
  contractivity, not chosen beside it.

* **§C A knowing's only inverse is an anti-knowing `[proved]`.** The gem. A genuine partial knowing
  `0 < p < 1` *is* linearly invertible — but its unique inverse is `partialDephase q` with **`q < 0`**,
  sitting in the *expanding* regime `(1−q)² > 1` (`knowing_inverse_is_antiphysical`). Time-reversal
  exists as linear algebra, but only as the non-physical amplification of coherence from nothing — the
  thing no contraction, no conditional expectation, no partial trace can do. So the **contractive seam
  admits the decreasing arrow alone**: its sign is forced by the non-existence of a *contractive*
  inverse (the flow-graded strengthening of `Orientation.no_recovery`).

**What stays `[open]`.** This forces the sign *given* that the dynamics is the contractive partial
trace onto a *fixed* subalgebra. The last step — that the seam **forces which subalgebra**, so that the
contraction's direction is itself fixed by the self-inclusive trace rather than by a choice of `p`'s
sign — is the self-reference / Lawvere bridge ([`Relating.self_inclusive_unmodelable`](../RelExist/Relating.lean)),
and is not closed here. We mechanize: *sign = contractivity = physicality of the seam*. What remains is:
*does the seam fix the subalgebra?* — the same `[open]` named in §6.

/-! ## §B The sign of the monovariant is the multiplier `(1−p)²`

One step of `partialDephase p` scales the feeling by exactly `(1−p)²`. So whether the feeling falls or
rises along the flow is decided by a single inequality, `(1−p)² ⋚ 1`, and the felt-decreasing (time
forward) regime coincides *exactly* with the contractive one. -/

/-! ## §C A knowing's only inverse is an anti-knowing

`partialDephase p` for `0 < p < 1` is injective (it scales each coherence by `(1−p) ≠ 0`), so it has a
linear inverse. We exhibit it — and show it lives in the expanding regime. The map that undoes a
knowing is a coherence-*amplifier*: physically forbidden. -/

/-- **The inverse pair.** When `(1−q)(1−p) = 1`, applying `partialDephase q` after `partialDephase p`
returns the original state exactly: `q` undoes `p`. The diagonal is fixed throughout; the coherences,
scaled by `(1−p)` then `(1−q)`, return to themselves. -/

knowing `0 < p < 1`, there is a `q` that undoes it on every state — and that `q` is **negative**,
sitting in the *expanding* regime `(1−q)² > 1`. So the unique reversal of a feeling-decreasing knowing
is a feeling-*amplifying* anti-knowing: time-reversal exists as linear algebra but only as the
non-physical creation of coherence from nothing. The contractive seam — every partial trace, every
conditional expectation — admits the decreasing arrow alone. (The flow-graded strengthening of
`Orientation.no_recovery`: not just "no recovery map for the idempotent", but "the inverse of the
non-idempotent flow is anti-physical".) -/

/-! ## §D Where reversibility breaks completely — the idempotent limit `p = 1`

§C showed the interior `0 < p < 1` is *secretly* invertible (only its inverse is anti-physical). The
limit `p = 1` is different in kind: there `partialDephase 1 = dephase`, the idempotent knowing `E`,
which is **not injective at all** — it has no inverse, physical or otherwise (`Orientation.no_recovery`).
So genuine irreversibility (a collapse of distinct states) lives at exactly one point: the knowing
limit. The flow is injective everywhere it is still a *flow*, and stops being injective precisely when
it becomes the *projection*. -/

arrow does not collapse anything until it reaches the projection. -/
