# The peripheral standard form — the fixed-point subalgebra is commutative, in any dimension

The conjecture lift's reconciliation (relation-algebra Decisions 1–2, [03.1 §3.6](../../docs/spec/03.1-sparsity.md))
asks knowing `E` to be a **spectral projection onto a commutative subalgebra** — the "standard form" of a
conditional expectation. [`Peripheral`](Peripheral.lean) discharged the **spectral** half at finite
dimension (`E = dephase` is `{0,1}`-spectral, no rotating peripheral part). What was named the residual
**mathlib gap** is the **operator-algebra standard form**: that the **peripheral (fixed-point) subalgebra
of `E` is commutative**, and that this is *not* an artefact of finite dimension.

This module closes the **algebraic core of that gap**, and closes it **dimension-independently**. The key
move: the commutativity of the fixed-point subalgebra is *not* an analytic fact about finite matrices — it
is a purely algebraic consequence of `E` being a **projection onto a commutative image**. So we state it
over an **arbitrary ring `𝒜`** (the operator algebra — `Matrix` for finite dimension, but equally the
bounded operators `B(H)` on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, or any C\*-algebra: all are `Ring`s):

* `PeripheralStandardForm` — the abstract interface: a projection `E : 𝒜 → 𝒜` (idempotent) whose **image
  is commutative** and **closed under product**, fixing `1`. This is the conditional-expectation /
  peripheral-projection data, stated for *any* `𝒜`, finite- or infinite-dimensional.
* `fix_comm` — **the fixed-point subalgebra is commutative**: `a, b ∈ Fix E ⟹ a·b = b·a`. The standard
  form, dimension-free — *this is the content the gap named, holding in `B(H)` exactly as in `Matrix`.*
* `fix_mul_mem`, `fix_one_mem`, `fix_add_mem` — `Fix E` is a **unital subring**: the peripheral subalgebra
  is genuinely a subalgebra, commutative by `fix_comm`.
* `dephaseStandardForm` — the **finite-dimensional witness**: `E = dephase` on `Matrix A A R` instantiates
  the interface (its image is the diagonal/classical fragment, which commutes — `Decoherence.classical_comm`).
  Plus `dephase` is **self-adjoint** (`transpose`-closed, `dephaseFix_transpose_mem`), so the fixed-point
  subalgebra is a genuine `*`-subalgebra — the full standard form for the canonical `E`.

**Honest scope.** The dimension-independent *algebra* of the standard form — the peripheral subalgebra is a
commutative unital subring whenever `E` projects onto a commutative image — is **closed here, for `𝒜` of
any dimension** (`fix_comm` et al.), with the canonical `E = dephase` exhibited as a witness. What this does
**not** do is the *analytic* general-CP input: that for an *arbitrary* primitive unital CP map `Φ_c` on
`B(H)` the peripheral eigenspace (modulus-1 spectrum) *is* the image of such a projection and *is*
commutative — the spectral/ergodic theorem placing a general `Φ_c` into this standard form. That analytic
placement (peripheral spectrum ↦ commutative subalgebra, infinite-dim) is the genuine operator-algebra
theorem that stays `[open]`; the **algebraic standard form it lands in is now built, and is built in
arbitrary dimension.**

/-! ### The finite-dimensional witness — `E = dephase` is in standard form

The canonical knowing operator `dephase` (keep the diagonal) instantiates the abstract interface: its image
is the **classical / diagonal fragment**, which is commutative (`Decoherence.classical_comm`) and closed
under product (`Decoherence.isClassical_mul`). So the abstract `fix_comm` specializes to: *the fixed points
of decoherence — the diagonal subalgebra — commute.* -/

interface is inhabited by the genuine knowing operator: decoherence is a projection onto the commutative,
