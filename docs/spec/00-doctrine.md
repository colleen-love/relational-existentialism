# 00 — The Doctrine

> *What the language is allowed to say.* Before any axiom, we fix the ambient
> mathematical universe in which "relating" is a primitive and "self" is a derived
> notion. This is the **doctrine**: a traced symmetric monoidal category extended
> with greatest fixed points, carrying a distinguished cartesian fragment.

The doctrine is chosen so that each of its three ingredients is load-bearing for a
specific philosophical commitment, and so that the one place the philosophy is
*lived* but the mathematics *generalizes* — the cartesian/monoidal seam — is
visible rather than hidden.

## 0.1 Why a category, and why morphisms first

A category `𝒞` consists of objects and, between them, morphisms that compose
associatively with identities. We read it relationally:

- **objects** `A, B, …` are *system-types* — the kinds of thing that can stand in
  relation;
- **morphisms** `f : A → B` are *relatings* — a relating *of* `A` *to* `B`;
- **composition** `g ∘ f` is *relating through* an intermediary.

This is already the inversion of the plain-language doc made structural: in a
category you cannot speak of an object except via the morphisms into and out of it
(Yoneda). An object's identity *is* its pattern of relatings. Relation is primitive;
the object is what the relatings determine. Axiom **A2** will make this precise.

We do **not** start from a category of "selves with relations attached." We start
from relatings, and selves appear only later, as fixed points (Axiom **A3**).

## 0.2 Symmetric monoidal structure — coexistence

A **symmetric monoidal category** (SMC) `(𝒞, ⊗, I, γ)` adds:

- a **tensor** `⊗ : 𝒞 × 𝒞 → 𝒞`, with `A ⊗ B` read as *`A` and `B` coexisting*;
- a **unit** `I` (the empty system; states of `A` are points `I → A`);
- coherent associators and unitors;
- a **symmetry** `γ_{A,B} : A ⊗ B → B ⊗ A` with `γ_{B,A} ∘ γ_{A,B} = id`, read as
  *coexistence is order-indifferent*.

`⊗` is not "and" as set-theoretic pairing; it is parallel coexistence with no
implied communication. Communication is a *morphism* between tensored systems.
This is the fragment in which **relation-primacy (A2)** is native: morphisms are the
data, objects are bookkeeping.

## 0.3 Trace — self-relation as feedback

A **trace** turns an output back into an input. A traced SMC equips `𝒞` with, for
all `A, B, U`, a function

$$
\mathrm{Tr}^{U}_{A,B} : \mathcal{C}(A \otimes U,\; B \otimes U) \;\longrightarrow\; \mathcal{C}(A,\;B)
$$

— "feed the `U`-output back into the `U`-input" — subject to the standard
Joyal–Street–Verity axioms:

1. **Naturality** (in `A` and `B`): tracing commutes with pre/post-composition on
   the non-fed wires.
2. **Dinaturality / sliding** (in `U`): a map on the feedback wire may slide around
   the loop.
3. **Vanishing I**: `Tr^I_{A,B}(f) = f` (feeding back the empty wire does nothing).
4. **Vanishing II**: `Tr^{U⊗V} = Tr^{U} ∘ Tr^{V}` (a compound loop is two loops).
5. **Superposing**: tracing is compatible with `⊗` (you may carry a bystander wire
   `W` through the loop).
6. **Yanking**: `Tr^{U}_{U,U}(γ_{U,U}) = id_U` (a loop with a single crossing is a
   straight wire).

The trace is the formal content of **self-relation**: a relating whose output is
returned to itself. Crucially, the trace needs **no copying** — it is definable in
compact-closed categories like `FdHilb` (where it is the partial trace). This is
what lets self-relation *as feedback* survive into the quantum fragment, even
though self-relation *as mirror* (next section) will not.

We name the unary self-relation operator

$$
\sigma(P) \;:=\; \mathrm{Tr}(P)
$$

`[structural; both]` — this is the operator the philosophy calls the *σ-move*, the
turning of a relating back on itself. Definition **D1** records the definition; Theorem
**T3** records its cartesian obstruction.

## 0.4 The cartesian fragment — copying, and the mirror

A category has **finite products** when `⊗` is the categorical product `×` and `I`
is terminal `1`. Such a category is automatically symmetric monoidal, but with two
extra natural transformations available at every object:

- the **diagonal** `Δ_A : A → A × A` — *copy*;
- the **delete** `!_A : A → 1` — *discard*;

making every object a commutative comonoid, *naturally* in `A`. The hallmark of the
**cartesian fragment** `𝒞_×` is exactly the presence of a uniform, natural `Δ`.

Two facts make `𝒞_×` the home of the philosophy-as-lived:

### 0.4.1 Trace in `𝒞_×` is a Conway fixed-point operator `[theorem; cartesian]`

**Theorem (Hasegawa; Hyland).** On a category with finite products, traces are in
bijection with **Conway fixed-point operators** — operators
`(–)^† : 𝒞(A × X, X) → 𝒞(A, X)` satisfying the Conway identities (naturality,
dinaturality, the diagonal/Bekič rule). Consequently every endomorphism arising by
feedback *has* a fixed point, canonically.

This is the precise sense of **"to relate is to create"** (Theorem **T1**): in the
cartesian fragment, looping does not merely rearrange — it *produces* a fixed
point that need not have pre-existed. Self-relation manufactures structure. (Caveat on the
mechanization: [T1 as *proved*](03-theorems.md) is only the Knaster–Tarski **greatest fixed point**
of a monotone map; the Hasegawa–Hyland trace↔Conway-operator bijection cited here is *not* verified
in the Lean — a gfp existing is generic to every monotone operator.)

### 0.4.2 The mirror that can't close is Lawvere's theorem `[theorem; cartesian]`

**Theorem (Lawvere).** In a cartesian closed category, if there is a
point-surjective morphism `A → B^A`, then **every** endomorphism `t : B → B` has a
fixed point. Contrapositive: if some `t : B → B` is *fixed-point-free*, then there
is **no** point-surjective `A → B^A` — no complete self-representation of `A`'s
function space inside `A`.

Read this as the **mirror that can't close**. A total self-model is a surjection of
a system onto its own space of self-relatings; Lawvere says the existence of any
"escaping" endomorphism forbids it. The diagonal `Δ` is exactly the move that makes
the diagonal argument run: *you must copy yourself to compare the copy against the
original*, and the comparison always produces a residue the copy omits. The
incompleteness of self-knowledge is not contingent; it is the contrapositive of a
theorem, and it lives precisely where copying is available.

## 0.5 Greatest fixed points — the `ν`-modality

For an endofunctor `F : 𝒞 → 𝒞`, an **`F`-coalgebra** is a map `x : X → F X`, and a
**final** coalgebra `out : νF → F(νF)` is terminal among them. Its carrier `νF` is
the **greatest fixed point** of `F`; the unique map into it is definition by
**coinduction**, and the proof principle is: *to show two states equal in `νF`,
exhibit a bisimulation*.

The doctrine is extended with a **`ν`-modality** giving, for the endofunctors we
need, their final coalgebras. Two uses:

- **Becoming.** A self is not a static datum but an *ongoing behavior*; behaviors
  are the canonical inhabitants of final coalgebras (streams, processes, eigenforms
  under continued return). The `ν`-layer is where "maintained rather than given"
  becomes a type, not a metaphor.
- **The "we".** Lived identity `≈` (the greatest bisimulation) is defined coinductively as the greatest
  relation closed under one step of mutual indistinguishability — a **bisimilarity**
  — and the shared world is the quotient `𝔼 := D/≈`. Theorem **T2** is stated here.

## 0.6 The seam — stated, not hidden

The two readings of self-relation come apart, and the doctrine is honest about it.

> **Proposition 0.1 (the seam).** Let `𝒞` be the ambient doctrine.
>
> 1. In the **cartesian fragment** `𝒞_×`, the obstruction to a complete self-model
>    is **Lawvere's diagonal argument**: it *requires* `Δ`, and the residue it
>    produces is the philosophy's *remainder* (§"Knowing and feeling").
> 2. In a **compact-closed (e.g. quantum) fragment** there is, by **no-cloning**,
>    no natural diagonal `Δ_A : A → A ⊗ A` at all. Here the analogous obstruction is
>    the *absence* of copying, **not** a fixed point of it.

The two obstructions are genuinely different mathematics — a fixed-point/diagonal
theorem versus a no-go on a natural transformation existing. The philosophy as
*lived* (a someone who looks at themselves and cannot close the loop) is the
**cartesian** story. The monoidal generalization buys **quantum reach** (Layer 4's
physics functor) at the cost of the literal mirror reading.

**Methodological consequence.** All the self-reference results — **D1's** mirror reading,
**T1**, **T3** — are stated in the cartesian fragment. The compact-closed fragment
inherits only what is fragment-neutral (`⊗`, `Tr`-as-feedback, `≈`). We never write
"`Δ`" in the quantum fragment, and Layer 4 will turn this discipline into a typing
theorem (no monoidal functor from the compact-closed fragment into the
cartesian-only domains).

`[structural; both]`

> **Proposition 0.2 (the seam is the non-comonoidal residue — one object, two faces).** Proposition 0.1
> records the two obstructions as *different proofs*. They are nonetheless **one object**. By **Fox's
