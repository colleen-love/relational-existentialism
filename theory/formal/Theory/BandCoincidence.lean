# The band-coincidence conjecture — does permanent feeling coincide with energy?

The open question named in [`03.8-space-energy.md`](../../docs/spec/03.8-space-energy.md)'s honest scope:
*"whether the seam-protected and rotating-protected bands coincide."* Two conservations were kept
strictly distinct there — **dynamical** (a coupling symmetry → the rotating spectrum → a conserved
charge, *energy*: [`RotatingSpectrum`](RotatingSpectrum.lean)) and **operational** (self-inclusion →
the un-attendable seam → permanent feeling: [`SeamForcing`](SeamForcing.lean)). As proved, the
undifferentiated ground splits *three* ways under the first arrow — **knowing** (the fixed band,
`μ = 1`), **energy** (the rotating band, `‖μ‖ = 1`, `μ ≠ 1`), and **permanent feeling** (the
seam-protected block `J`). This module asks whether the last two are the **same band**, which would
collapse the split to *two* terms: `undifferentiated = knowing + energy`, no third remainder.

## The bridge (Task 0) — one carrier

Both structures live on a single ambient space `Matrix A A ℂ`. A coupling is `μ : A → A → ℂ` with channel
`Φ = schur μ`; the seam is a predicate `J : A → A → Prop` (the self-inclusive, un-attendable edges). For a
predicate `P` on edges, `bandOn P` is the submodule of coherences supported on `P`-edges. Then:

* `seamBand J  := bandOn J`                         — coherences on the seam (operationally conserved);
* `rotatingBand μ := bandOn (rotatingEdge μ)`        — `‖μ i j‖ = 1 ∧ μ i j ≠ 1` (dynamically conserved);
* `fixedBand μ := bandOn (fixedEdge μ)`              — `μ i j = 1` (the known / classical record);
* `conservedBand μ := bandOn (conservedEdge μ)`      — `‖μ i j‖ = 1` (the undissipated ground).

This is a *witness-level* identification, not a posited functor: the seam's `defectSq`-protection
(`SeamForcing.self_cannot_fully_decohere`) and the rotating band's magnitude-conservation
(`schur_sustained`) are transported onto this common carrier, where the coincidence becomes a question
about which *edges* each band occupies.

## The hypotheses (the content lives here)

* `UnitaryBaseline μ J` — the only source of `‖μ i j‖ < 1` is attention, and the fixed band is exactly
  the diagonal. So un-attendable seam edges keep modulus one (`seam_undamped`) and every off-diagonal
  edge that survives genuinely rotates (`fixed_eq_diagonal : μ i j = 1 ↔ i = j` — a nondegenerate
  baseline). The Lindblad reading: unitary `H` (+ nondegenerate spectrum) and a dissipator `D` that *is*
  attention.
* `SeamOffdiagonal J` — the seam carries no diagonal (known) coherence (`∀ i, ¬ J i i`). The seam is the
  *live* off-diagonal coherence of the relationship.
* `Align μ J` **(the bet, `H_align : ker D = J`)** — every *attendable* off-diagonal edge strictly
  decays: `¬ J i j → i ≠ j → ‖μ i j‖ < 1`. In words: *the only coherence that does not dissipate is the
  coherence you cannot attend to.* This **is** the conjecture in operator form.

## What is proved (`sorry`-free, footprint reported below)

* `seamBand_subset_rotating` `[follows]` — `UnitaryBaseline ∧ SeamOffdiagonal ⇒ seamBand ⊆ rotatingBand`.
* `rotating_subset_seamBand` `[proved under Align]` — `Align ⇒ rotatingBand ⊆ seamBand`. (Consumes the bet.)
* `band_coincidence` `[proved under hypotheses]` — the coincidence `seamBand = rotatingBand`.
* `conserved_internal_split` / `undifferentiated_two_term` `[follows]` — the conserved ground is the
  internal direct sum `fixedBand ⊕ rotatingBand` (`⊓ = ⊥`, `⊔ = conservedBand`); under the coincidence,
  `= fixedBand ⊕ seamBand` — *undifferentiated = knowing + energy*, **no third summand**.
* `rotatingBand_sustained` — every coherence of a `rotatingBand` matrix has magnitude *exactly* conserved
  along the orbit (`schur_sustained`, transported): the submodule really is the magnitude-conserved one.
* **Witnesses.** `coincidence_witness` puts the rotating edge `(0,1)`/`(1,0)` *inside* `J` and the
  transient edges *outside*: the witness satisfies all three hypotheses (incl. the bet `Align`), so
  `band_coincidence` yields `seamBand = rotatingBand` concretely. `three_term_without_alignment` drops
  the bet — a second rotating edge `(0,2)` placed *outside* `J` — exhibiting `seamBand ⊊ rotatingBand`
  (`alignment_fails` shows `Align` is genuinely violated): the two-term form is **not** free; it earns
  `Align`.

## Honest scope

`[reading]` (the standing identifications, same status as "‖μ‖=1 = energy", "flow = time"): that `J`
*is* the genuine un-attendable seam of `Relating.self_inclusive_unmodelable`; and the headline
`Align = "energy is exactly un-attendable feeling."` `[open]` (narrated, **not** built): the general
CPTP peripheral **structure theorem** (rotating unitaries normalize `Fix`; crossed-product) and the full
`L = −i[H,·] + D` generator split — the same `[open]` items already in `03.8`; the deep residue is
whether the *genuine* decohering channel `Φ_c` satisfies `Align`, which stays a bet. Provenance **R / S**:
decoherence-free subspaces and spectral splits are standard; the synthesis is identifying the
*un-attendable* subspace with the *conserved-charge* subspace.

For an edge predicate `P`, `bandOn P` is the coherences supported on `P`-edges: a genuine

so the coincidence question becomes a question about *which edges* each predicate selects. -/
