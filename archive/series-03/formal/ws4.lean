WS4 (`series-03/spec/ws4/04-charter-design-review.md`, v3): **graded parthood over
a good quantale** — the `Q`-weighted `<κ`-supported observation functor `W_Q`, its
terminal coalgebra, and a coherent graded weak distributive law, instantiated at
the concrete non-idempotent Łukasiewicz witness `Łₙ` (the v3 resolution).

## Outcome: PARTIAL, not Discharged (honest classification)

The design's §6 defines **Discharge** around Layer C — weak-pullback preservation
(`WQRel_le_comp`, step 6), the "one genuinely new proof" and the whole point of
committing to `Łₙ` — together with `wq_reduces_to_pk` (step 16) and the full
step-20 bundle. **Those are not proved here** (see "Scope held open"). This file is
`sorry`-free/axiom-free and delivers a large genuine fragment — the enriched carrier
with its full identity theory (Layers A–B), the graded weak law's *multiplication*
coherence (Layer D: pentagon/unit/reflection), and the `Łₙ` `DivisibleQuantale`
witness with `tensor_section` proved and **consumed** (`weight_split`) — but it does
NOT achieve the registered Discharge, and nothing here is named as if it did. Layer
C is registered as a **typed open obligation** (`WQPreservesWeakPullback`), not
asserted; the top-level bundle is named `ws4_graded_coherence_Luk`, *not*
`ws4_resolved`, precisely so a downstream `import` cannot mistake the delivered
coherence for the registered discharge. This is neither Discharge nor the §8
Impossibility branch (`ws4_no_quantitative_grading` is likewise unproved): step 6 is
left open with its obstruction made precise, not decided in either direction.

Built on `ws1`/`ws2`/`ws3` (imported, axiom-free): the `Cofix`/QPF terminal-coalgebra
route, `Cardinal.iSup_lt_of_isRegular`/`mul_lt_of_lt` bounds, `ws3`'s `alg`/`pkJoin`
template mirrored here in graded form.

## What is proved — all `sorry`-free and **axiom-free** beyond Mathlib's standard
`propext` / `Classical.choice` / `Quot.sound` (verified via `#print axioms
ws4_graded_coherence_Luk`; the `Łₙ` witness and `weight_split` are even choice-free
— `[propext, Quot.sound]`).

* **§2 The quantale class hierarchy** — `GoodQuantale` / `DivisibleQuantale`
  (design §2.1–2.2, P1/P3 fixes: `1` is the `⊗`-unit not `⊤`; `tensor_section` the
  residuation gate).
* **§2.3 The concrete non-idempotent witness `Łₙ`** (the v3 resolution). The MV
  chain `Fin (n+1)` with `a ⊗ b = a + b ⊖ n` is exhibited as a `DivisibleQuantale`:
  `tensor_sSup`, `bot_tensor`, **and the load-bearing `tensor_section`** are all
  proved constructively (`omega`/finite-sup), and `ws4_quantitative_witness`
  certifies `Łₙ` is **non-idempotent** for `n ≥ 2` (step 19 — the tripwire that
  grading is genuinely quantitative, not a frame in disguise). This is exactly the
  step v3 committed to in order to *discharge* WS4 rather than leave step 6 a hope.
* **§3 The functor `W_Q` as a QPF** (Layer A, steps 1–2): `WQObj`, `WQMap`
  (`Q`-sup pushforward over fibres — lattice joins only, design §3 P2/P4), the
  functor laws, and the QPF instance `qpfWQ` (`absWQ`/`reprWQ` support-exact
  reconstruction). Needs only `[CompleteLattice Q]`.
* **§4 Terminal coalgebra, Lambek, bisimulation** (Layer A step 3, Layer B steps
  4–5): `νWQ`/`νWQ_terminal` via `Cofix`, `wqLambek`, `wq_bisim_eq`, and
  `wq_bisim_behavioural` (behavioural equivalence = identity — criteria (i)–(iii)
  for the enriched carrier).
* **§5 The graded weak distributive law** (Layer D, steps 10–13): `wqPure` (point
  mass at `1`), `wqJoin` (graded Egli–Milner union, regularity load-bearing for its
  `< κ` bound), `wqAlg` via the Lambek inverse, and its coherence: `wqAlg_pentagon`
  (the [REV-B]-corrected "join of destructors" form, S2), `wqAlg_unit` (the
  `T`-unit law), `wq_reflects_part` (graded upward constitution).
* **§Layer C (registered, NOT proved).** `WQRel` (the weighted Barr lifting) and
  `WQPreservesWeakPullback` are given explicit types as the **named open
  obligation** for step 6; no theorem inhabits the latter. `weight_split` proves —
  and thereby *consumes* — the one algebraic fact those targets need from `Łₙ`'s
  residuation (`tensor_section`): every `w ≤ a ⊗ ⊤` factors as `a ⊗ b`.
* **§6 Assembly** (Layer E, proved fragment): `GradedWeakLawCoherence` /
  `ws4_graded_law_coherence` (class-level multiplication coherence), and
  `ws4_graded_coherence_Luk` — the top-level bundling at `Q = Łₙ`: graded weak-law
  coherence ∧ behavioural-equivalence-is-identity ∧ quantitative (non-idempotent).
  These are **renamed away** from the design's `GradedWeakBialgebra` / `ws4_resolved`
  because they prove strictly less (no `algJoin`, no `noStrictLaw`, no Layer C, no
  step-16 reduction); the names match the proposition, not the registered discharge.
  Criterion (iv)'s canonicity is separately open (charter §9, §7 [REV-B]).

## Scope held open (named and TYPED, not relabeled — charter §8.2 discipline)

The design's Layer C (weak-pullback preservation, steps 6–9), the `wqAlg_join`
associativity (step 13), and the `wq_reduces_to_pk` Bool-reduction (step 16) are
**not** formalized here. The v3 design flags step 6 as "the one genuinely new proof
… attack first, may resist"; it is the substantive research content and is left
open. The obstruction is made precise rather than merely named: (i) the target
`WQPreservesWeakPullback` is a typed hole a downstream WS can discharge; (ii)
`weight_split` isolates and proves the pointwise `⊗`-factorization the proof would
consume, so what remains is specifically the *global witness assembly* — building a
single weighted graph whose fibre-sup projections match, where the naive composite
weight `wR(x,y) ⊗ wS(y,z)` fails to project unless the middle's outgoing weight is
`1`. That non-normalization is the concrete difficulty, and it is not resolved here.
The §8 negative theorem `ws4_no_quantitative_grading` is likewise not proved, so the
step-6 fork is genuinely open, not silently decided. Canonicity (the WS3-inherited
question) stays open at the `(Q,κ)` level, as the charter requires.

## Hypothesis accounting

`hreg : κ.IsRegular` is load-bearing in `wqJoin`'s `< κ` bound (a `<κ`-indexed sup of
`<κ` cardinals is `<κ` only for regular `κ` — `Cardinal.iSup_lt_of_isRegular`), exactly
as in `ws3.pkJoin`. `hinf = hreg.aleph0_le` bounds singletons (`wqPure`). Existence /
functoriality / Lambek / bisim need only `[CompleteLattice Q]` and no cardinal
hypothesis. `hQsmall : #Q ≤ κ` (the QPF shape count) is **vacuous at `Łₙ`** (finite)
and is routed to WS7 as the `(F,κ,μ,#Q)` collector duty (design §3 [S1]). No custom
axioms; `Classical.choice` enters only via Mathlib's `sSup`/terminal-coalgebra base.

The polynomial functor `WQP` has shapes `Σ a : κ.ord.toType, (positions a → Q)` —
an ordinal bound `a` **together with a weight profile** on its positions — and
positions `{b // b < a}`. `abs` reads off the pushforward `pushQ w g`; `repr`
enumerates the support by the ordinal segment of order-type `(#supp).ord` and reads
its weights. At `Q = Łₙ` the weight profile ranges over the finite `Fin (n+1)`, so
the shape count is `< κ` outright (design §3 [S1]: `hQsmall` is vacuous). -/

/-! ### Layer C — weak-pullback preservation, stated as a NAMED OPEN OBLIGATION

The design's step 6 (`WQRel_le_comp`, "the one genuinely new proof") is **not**
proved in this file. Rather than leave it an unstated hope, we give its targets
explicit Lean types so the gap is a *typed hole* a downstream workstream can
discharge, and — below, in `weight_split` — we isolate and prove the one algebraic
fact those targets are meant to consume (the `⊗`-factorization from `tensor_section`),
so the obstruction is made precise: what remains is the global witness assembly, not
the pointwise residuation. -/

/-! ## §5 The graded weak distributive law (design Layer D, steps 10–14)

The `Q`-weighted composition monad's multiplication `wqJoin` (the graded
Egli–Milner union — a `Q`-sup of `⊗`-scaled fibres over the support), its unit
`wqPure` (point mass at the monoid unit `1`), and the composition operator
`wqAlg` built through the Lambek inverse. This mirrors `ws3`'s `alg`/`pkJoin`
with the join replaced by its graded form. Needs `[GoodQuantale Q]` (for `⊗`,
`bot_tensor`, `tensor_sSup`) and regularity for the `wqJoin` bound (design §5:
`hreg` load-bearing in `wqJoin`, exactly as in `ws3`). -/

associativity, step 13) and `noStrictLaw` (the graded impossibility), and its
step-20 `ws4_resolved` bundles `ws4_weak_pullback_Luk` (Layer C) and
`wq_reduces_to_pk` (step 16) — none of which are proved here. Using those names
would let a downstream `import` trust a stronger fact than is proved (the drift the
design's §8.2 forbids). The names below claim exactly the *multiplication
coherence* that is proved: pentagon + `T`-unit + part-reflection. -/

not the registered discharge. What `Łₙ` *does* certify, via its `DivisibleQuantale`
instance and `weight_split`, is that the residuation gate `tensor_section` is
satisfiable and factorizing for a non-idempotent `Q` — the pointwise input Layer C
