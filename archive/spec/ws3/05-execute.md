I'll start by merging main and reading the WS3 spec.

Merge succeeded. Now let me read the WS3 target spec plus supporting docs.

This is the most complex workstream yet — a no-go theorem (Part A) plus a weak bialgebra (Part B). Let me read the design and conceptualize docs, and check my `ws2.lean`/`ws1.lean` exports.

This is a large two-part deliverable (a no-go theorem + a weak bialgebra). Let me check the key Mathlib cardinal lemmas for the bounded union (`join` needs a regular-cardinal sup bound) and confirm my ws1/ws2 exports.

I have the key lemmas (`mk_biUnion_le`, `iSup_lt_of_isRegular`, `mul_lt_of_lt`, `IsRegular.aleph0_le`). This is a large two-part deliverable; I'll build it incrementally. Let me start with Part B's algebra core (join, alg, pentagon, unit, reflects, join-coherence) and validate before adding Part A and the assembly.

Good — `alg_join` (the hardest, the bounded-union associativity swap) compiled. Three fixable issues: `mk_pair_lt` metavariables, and two `simp` calls that need adjusting. Let me fix:

The outer `simp` in `alg_join` already fully decomposed the hypotheses, so the inner simps found nothing. Let me make `alg_join` robust with an explicit membership characterization lemma instead of fragile simp normal forms:

Chunk 1 (the algebra core, including the tricky `alg_join` associativity) compiles sorry-free. Now let me add Part A (the no-go theorem), the non-triviality witnesses, and the assembled structure. Let me also fix the WIP header:

Now append Part A, the non-triviality witnesses, and the assembled structure:

Two issues: `Bool : Type 0` isn't `Type u` (universe-polymorphism fails), and the `reflectsPart` field binder. Let me fix the carrier to `ULift Bool` and the field:

Entire `ws3.lean` compiles sorry-free. Now wire it into `Series3.lean`, do the full build, and run the axiom audit:

Let me see the full axiom lists for the two that reference the sanctioned import:

Axiom audit confirmed:
- **Part B lemmas** (`alg_pentagon`, `alg_unit_idem`, `alg_join`, `reflects_part`, `omega_fix`, `alg_nontrivial`, `pkJoin`): only `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.
- **`ws3_no_distributive_law`** and **`ws3_weak_bialgebra`**: those three **+ `KlinSalamanca_no_law`** (the one sanctioned import).

Let me clean up, do the full build, and verify sorry-free:

Full build green, no `sorry`, exactly one declared axiom (`KlinSalamanca_no_law`). Let me commit and push:

Done. Merged main and delivered WS3, pushed to `claude/charter-design-lean-proof-k1l3zl`.

## Summary

**`series-3/formal/ws3.lean`** realizes `04-charter-design-review.md` (Commitment 4 / criterion (iv) — bidirectional constitution) as the design's **two-part theorem**, built on the imported ws1/ws2 results, wired into the build via `import ws3` in `Series3.lean`.

**Part A — the gate, as a theorem** (Impossibility proved = success):
- `DistLaw` — a pointed-functor distributive law of `P_κ` over itself (naturality + both unit laws, exactly Klin–Salamanca's setting).
- `KlinSalamanca_no_law` — the design's explicitly-sanctioned **route-2 import** (MFPS 2018 Thm 2.4; the `P_f` scope note transfers to `P_κ` since every object in their diagonal proof has ≤4 elements `< κ`).
- `ws3_no_distributive_law` — no strict `λ` of the §3.4 form exists.

**Part B — the content, via the Egli–Milner weak law** (all sorry-free, Mathlib-only): `pkJoin` (bounded union), `alg` (via the Lambek inverse; `dest(alg t) = ⋃_{x∈t} dest x`), `alg_pentagon`, `alg_unit_idem`, `alg_join`, `reflects_part` (upward constitution; `dest` is downward), `omega_fix`, and `alg_nontrivial` (strong form, with genuinely incomparable witnesses Ω and an object whose sole part is empty). Assembled as `WeakBialgebra` / `ws3_weak_bialgebra`, carrying `noStrictLaw` (Part A) as a field so the substitution can't be read as a relabeling.

**Build compiles, sorry-free** — full `lake build` green; no `sorry`/`admit`; exactly one declared axiom.

## `#print axioms` — flagging

- **Part B lemmas** (`alg_pentagon`, `alg_unit_idem`, `alg_join`, `reflects_part`, `omega_fix`, `alg_nontrivial`, `pkJoin`): **only `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`** — Mathlib's standard three.
- **`ws3_no_distributive_law`** and **`ws3_weak_bialgebra`**: those three **plus `KlinSalamanca_no_law`**.

Flagging per your request:
- **`Classical.choice`** — present (terminal-coalgebra machinery, the Lambek inverse, and `pkJoin`'s regular-cardinal bound). Part of the ZFC/Mathlib ambient declared in WS3 Phase 1; anticipated, not a surprise.
- **`KlinSalamanca_no_law`** — a **non-Mathlib axiom**, but *not* AFA-encoding: it's the sanctioned published no-go theorem (Part A route 2), entering only `ws3_no_distributive_law` and (via the `noStrictLaw` field) `ws3_weak_bialgebra`. It carries the usual soundness caveat of an imported result — I defined `DistLaw` faithfully to KS's hypotheses (naturality + both pointed-functor unit laws) so its emptiness is exactly what KS proves.
- **No AFA-encoding axiom** — AFA is modeled coalgebraically (`νP_κ` = the final coalgebra); none introduced.

Two notes worth surfacing: (1) I **corrected the design's pentagon type** — its `PkMap κ alg (join (…))` is ill-typed (a level off); the well-typed Egli–Milner coherence is `dest(alg t) = ⋃_{x∈t} dest x`, which is what I proved. (2) Unlike WS2, **`hreg` is genuinely load-bearing** here — the bounded union is `< κ` only for regular `κ` (a `<κ`-indexed sup needs cofinality) — documented in the file header.
